# DeleteDuplicates
The attached C++ program deletes all file duplicates in a given path. Only one copy of each file remains in the specified folder.

If you download a file more than once in windows, a duplicate file will be created. the new file will have the same name except the suffix "(number)",
while number represents how many duplicates you have already on your disk. This program loops through all files in a given folder, and for each one it
searches for the original file. If the original file exists, all the duplicates will be deleted. If not, only one duplicate 
(eg. a file with the suffix "(num)") will remain.

I built this program as a way of emptying my very full disk, which also happens to contain a lot of redundant files!
At the meantime, I am working on a UI for the program using Java.
